## Description:
This is an app that allows users to replace word with another word inside of a word doc. Currently there is no limit on the number of word pairs within the app. Users are also able to track their histories of uploads through History tab.

## Origin / Background Story

JJ No Fish orgininated from my own phobic against fish due to a childhood trauma. This aims to be a prototype for a tool that works as a filter-of-all, the ideal version would work not just with word docs within a webapp, but all types of files, graphics and videos on a browser, a device or even embedded within an OS directly.

> For this project itself, it serves as my first experiment for replacing words that trigger bad experience with words that are more acceptable. It is an app that definitely owns its uniqueness against all the projects I have completed with CS50, even all my online projects so far. It's not an email service, not a network app and definitely not an auction app ðŸ˜œ
