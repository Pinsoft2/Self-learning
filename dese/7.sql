-- DESE is preparing a report on schools in the Cambridge school district. In 7.sql, write a SQL query to find the names of schools (public or charter!) in the Cambridge school district. Keep in mind that Cambridge, the city, contains a few school districts, but DESE is interested in the district whose name is “Cambridge.”

SELECT schools.name FROM schools JOIN districts ON districts.id = schools.district_id
WHERE districts.name = "Cambridge";
