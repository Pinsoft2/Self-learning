## Overview:
JJNoFish is a unique application designed to alleviate discomfort caused by specific words or phrases. By allowing users to replace triggering terms with more acceptable alternatives, JJNoFish aims to create a more pleasant reading experience. Whether it‚Äôs overcoming childhood phobias or simply personalizing content, this app provides a customizable solution.

## Origin / Background Story

JJ No Fish orgininated from my own phobic against fish due to a childhood trauma. This aims to be a prototype for a tool that works as a filter-of-all, the ideal version would work not just with word docs within a webapp, but all types of files, graphics and videos on a browser, a device or even embedded within an OS directly.

> For this project itself, it serves as my first experiment for replacing words that trigger bad experience with words that are more acceptable. It is an app that definitely owns its uniqueness against all the projects I have completed with CS50, even all my online projects so far. It's not an email service, not a network app and definitely not an auction app üòú

## Key Features
Word Replacement: Users can upload word documents and specify word pairs for replacement. JJNoFish then processes the document, replacing the designated words with their alternatives.
Unlimited Word Pairs: Unlike other tools, JJNoFish doesn‚Äôt impose restrictions on the number of word pairs. Users can customize their experience by adding as many replacements as needed.
History Tracking: The app maintains a history of uploaded documents, making it easy for users to revisit and modify their replacements over time.
